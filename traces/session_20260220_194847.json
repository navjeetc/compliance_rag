Alert organizational personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities, organizational\npersonnel with information security and privacy responsibilities, and system/network\nadministrators upon detection of unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of audit\ninformation.\nDiscussion: Audit information includes all information needed to successfully audit system\nactivity, such as audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable\ninformation. Audit logging tools are those programs and devices used to conduct system audit\nand logging activities. Protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits\n12/27/2024\nCJISSECPOL v6.0 the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals.

Requiring privileged access to be further defined between\naudit-related privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with audit-related\nprivileges.\nRelated Controls: AC-5.

This includes the\nretention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nrequests, subpoenas, and law enforcement actions.

In determining the set of event types that require logging, organiza\ue000ons\nconsider the monitoring and audi\ue000ng appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For\ncompleteness, event logging includes all protocols that are opera\ue000onal and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and audi\ue000ng requirements with other system needs, event logging requires\niden\ue000fying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in \ue000me. For example,\norganiza\ue000ons may determine that systems need the capability to log every \ufb01le access successful and\nunsuccessful, but not ac\ue000vate that capability except for speci\ufb01c circumstances due to the poten\ue000al\nburden on system performance. The types of events that organiza\ue000ons desire to be logged may\nchange. Reviewing and upda\ue000ng the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events\nremain relevant and con\ue000nue to support the needs of the organiza\ue000on. Organiza\ue000ons consider how\nthe types of logging events can reveal informa\ue000on about individuals that may give rise to privacy\nrisk and how best to mi\ue000gate such risks. For example, there is the poten\ue000al to reveal personally\niden\ue000\ufb01able informa\ue000on in the audit trail, especially if the logging event is based on pa\ue001erns or \ue000me of\nusage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log speci\ufb01c event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1), CM-3f,\nCM-5(1), IA-3(3)(b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22),\nSI-7(8), and SI-10(1).

Audit records can be generated\nat various levels, including at the packet level as informa\ue000on traverses the network. Selec\ue000ng the\nappropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and audi\ue000ng capability and can\niden\ue000fy the root causes of problems. When de\ufb01ning event types, organiza\ue000ons consider the logging\nnecessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transac\ue000on-based processes\nand the ac\ue000ons that occur in service-oriented architectures.\nRelated controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-11,\nAU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-7, SC-18,\nSI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11.\n(1) EVENT LOGGING | COMPILATION OF AUDIT RECORDS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AU-12.]\nThis document is produced from OSCAL source data\nFAMILY: AU PAGE 52\fNIST SP 800-53 Revision 5.1 Security and Privacy Controls for Informa\ue000on Systems and Organiza\ue000ons\nThis publica\ue000on ",

Encryption is a great tool that can be applied to\naccomplish this protection and ensure compliance with the vast majority of the CJI requirements.\nCJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2 details when encryption is required and provides information\non the exceptions to the encryption requirement. Achieving CJIS Security Policy Compliance: To determine when encryption is required one must first read and understand CJIS Security Policy\nSection 5.9.1 Physically Secure Location. The reason for this is simple: encryption is not required\nwhile within a physically secure location. Conversely, when ever CJI is transmitted or stored (at\nrest) outside the boundaries of a physically secure location encryption may be required. The exact\nstandards to which the data would be required to meet are detailed along with any exceptions in\nCJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2. Additionally, both security awareness training and personnel security requirements can be affected\nby whether or not CJI is encrypted. Requirements surrounding these Policy areas is determined by\nanswering the following question: Who has unescorted access to unencrypted CJI? Unless personnel is escorted, security awareness training is required as correlated with the access\nlevel needed by personnel as identified in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.2. Similarly, fingerprint-\nbased background checks as detailed in CJIS Security Pol icy Section 5.12 may be required on\nindividuals to permit unescorted access to CJI. The intent of all these requirements is to limit access to CJI to only authorized personnel.

Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a manner that only people\nwith the knowledge or means to decrypt the message can do so. But how does this work? In an encryption process, legible data , referred to as plaintext, is encrypted by applying a cipher\n(otherwise known as an encryption algorithm or crypto key) to the data. The data then becomes\nencrypted and is now referred to as ciphertext . The ciphertext is essentially unreadable until\ndecrypted. The decryption process requires the process of applying the same algorithm (crypto\nkey) to encrypt the data in an inverse manner to convert the data back into plaintext.

Encryption is a great tool that can be applied to\naccomplish this protection and ensure compliance with the vast majority of the CJI requirements.\nCJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2 details when encryption is required and provides information\non the exceptions to the encryption requirement. Achieving CJIS Security Policy Compliance: To determine when encryption is required one must first read and understand CJIS Security Policy\nSection 5.9.1 Physically Secure Location. The reason for this is simple: encryption is not required\nwhile within a physically secure location. Conversely, when ever CJI is transmitted or stored (at\nrest) outside the boundaries of a physically secure location encryption may be required. The exact\nstandards to which the data would be required to meet are detailed along with any exceptions in\nCJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2. Additionally, both security awareness training and personnel security requirements can be affected\nby whether or not CJI is encrypted. Requirements surrounding these Policy areas is determined by\nanswering the following question: Who has unescorted access to unencrypted CJI? Unless personnel is escorted, security awareness training is required as correlated with the access\nlevel needed by personnel as identified in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.2. Similarly, fingerprint-\nbased background checks as detailed in CJIS Security Pol icy Section 5.12 may be required on\nindividuals to permit unescorted access to CJI. The intent of all these requirements is to limit access to CJI to only authorized personnel. CJIS\nSecurity Policy Appendix A: Terms and Definitions defines a\nuthorized user/personnel as a n\nindividual, or group of individuals, who have been appropriately vetted through a national fingerprint-\nbased record check and have been granted access to CJI. 12/27/2024\nCJISSECPOL v6.0\nG.6-3 What is Encryption? Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a manner that only people\nwith the knowledge or means to decrypt the message can do so. But how does this work? In an encryption process, legible data , referred to as plaintext, is encrypted by applying a cipher\n(otherwise known as an encryption algorithm or crypto key) to the data. The data then becomes\nencrypted and is now referred to as ciphertext . The ciphertext is essentially unreadable until\ndecrypted. The decryption process requires the process of applying the same algorithm (crypto\nkey) to encrypt the data in an inverse manner to convert the data back into plaintext. Encryption is important because it allows you to securely protect data that you don't want anyone\nelse to have access to. Encryption has ",

However, the device itself should have login attempt\nlimits consistent with the risk associated to the data or configurations accessible on the device\nitself.

General Password/PIN Requirements for Mobile Devices:**\\n*   **Minimum Password Protections:** The minimum password protections identified in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.6.2.1 may not be appropriate for the device PIN/password due to immediate access requirements for some device functions and the difficulty of entering complex passwords on small screens (cjis.txt, Minimum Password/Pin).\\n*   **Layered Authentication for CJI Access:** In cases where the risk of a complex password on the device itself is deemed significant, a layered authentication approach may be necessary. CJI or access to CJI must be protected via one or more additional layers of access control beyond the device PIN/password (cjis.txt, Minimum Password/Pin; cjis.txt, Access requirement specification).\\n*   **Cryptographically Segregated CJI:** If CJI or access to CJI is cryptographically segregated from applications accessible using the device level PIN/Password (e.g., secure application or secure browser), the authentication mechanism for that secure application or browser may satisfy CJIS Security Policy requirements if it is fully compliant as a stand-alone application (cjis.txt, Minimum Password/Pin).\\n*   **Device-Level PIN/Password Insufficiency:** Access to CJI utilizing *only* the device level password or PIN and device embedded credentials is not compliant with CJIS Security Policy, unless protected with Advanced Authentication, which is currently not possible on most devices (cjis.txt, Embedded passwords/login tied to device PIN).\\n*   **Integrated Device Functions:** Use of integrated device functions (e.g., built-in email or chat) to store or transmit CJI would also not be compliant if relying solely on the device-level PIN/password (cjis.txt, Embedded passwords/login tied to device PIN).\\n*   **Robust Passwords for CJI Protection:** A layered security deployment is recommended where the device PIN protects only basic device functions (e.g., phone, camera, non-secure applications), and a more robust password or multifactor authentication is used to protect applications or data storage that contain CJI to achieve policy compliance (cjis.txt, Access requirement specification).\\n*   **Data Sharing Controls:** Careful attention must be placed on the capability to share data (e.g., cut and paste or screenshot functions) between secure applications with CJI or CJI access and basic device functions with limited security controls (cjis.txt, Access requirement specification).\\n\\n**2. Login Attempt Limits and Actions for Mobile Devices:**\\n*   **Secure Application Login Limits:** It may be appropriate to fully comply with CJIS login attempt limits within a secure application or container, rather than solely at the device level (cjis.txt, Special Login attempt limit).\\n*   **Device Login Limits:** The device itself should have login attempt limits consistent with the risk associated with the data or configurations accessible on the device itself (cjis.txt, Special Login attempt limit).\\n*   **Remote Wipe/Self-Deletion:** Devices can typically be configured to perform actions based on serial unsuccessful login attempts, such as deleting all data on the device, issuing an alert, or enabling a full device wipe (cjis.txt, Special Login attempt limit; cjis.txt, Login failure actions).\\n*   **CJIS Policy Exception for Device Level:** Where all CJI on the device is protected by an additional layer of encryption, protected by a subsequent secure application authentication method (which is technically prevented from being the same as the device level password via complexity/entry rules), the number of invalid attempts at the device level password may exceed the CJIS Security Policy (cjis.txt, Login failure actions).\\n\\n**3. Specific Critical Security Controls (CSC) for Passwords and Authentication:**\\n*   **CSC 12-6 (Password Storage):** Passwords must be hashed or encrypted in storage. Hashed passwords should be salted and follow guidance provided in NIST SP 800-132 or similar guidance. Files containing these passwords required for systems to authenticate users must be readable only with super-user privileges (cjis.txt, CSC 12-6).\\n*   **CSC 12-9 (Password Reuse):** Operating systems must be configured so that passwords cannot be re-used within a timeframe of six months (cjis.txt, CSC 12-9).\\n*   **CSC 12-12 (Multifactor Authentication for Administrative Access):** Multifactor authentication must be used for all administrative access, including domain administrative access (cjis.txt, CSC 12-12).\\n*   **CSC 12-13 (NEW) (Certificate Protection):** When using certificates to enable multi-factor certificate-based authentication, private keys must be protected using strong passwords or stored in trusted, secure hardware tokens (cjis.txt, CSC 12-13).\\n*   **Service Account Passwords:** All service accounts must have long and difficult-to-guess passwords that are changed on a periodic basis, similar to traditional user and administrative passwords (cjis.txt, Ensure that all service accounts...).')], _name=None, _meta={'model': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 3122, 'completion_tokens': 1088, 'total_tokens': 5343, 'thoughts_token_count': 1133}})",
