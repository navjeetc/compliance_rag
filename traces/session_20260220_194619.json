Encryption is a great tool that can be applied to\naccomplish this protection and ensure compliance with the vast majority of the CJI requirements.\nCJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2 details when encryption is required and provides information\non the exceptions to the encryption requirement. Achieving CJIS Security Policy Compliance: To determine when encryption is required one must first read and understand CJIS Security Policy\nSection 5.9.1 Physically Secure Location. The reason for this is simple: encryption is not required\nwhile within a physically secure location. Conversely, when ever CJI is transmitted or stored (at\nrest) outside the boundaries of a physically secure location encryption may be required. The exact\nstandards to which the data would be required to meet are detailed along with any exceptions in\nCJIS Security Policy Section 5.10.1.2. Additionally, both security awareness training and personnel security requirements can be affected\nby whether or not CJI is encrypted. Requirements surrounding these Policy areas is determined by\nanswering the following question: Who has unescorted access to unencrypted CJI? Unless personnel is escorted, security awareness training is required as correlated with the access\nlevel needed by personnel as identified in CJIS Security Policy Section 5.2. Similarly, fingerprint-\nbased background checks as detailed in CJIS Security Pol icy Section 5.12 may be required on\nindividuals to permit unescorted access to CJI. The intent of all these requirements is to limit access to CJI to only authorized personnel. CJIS\nSecurity Policy Appendix A: Terms and Definitions defines a\nuthorized user/personnel as a n\nindividual, or group of individuals, who have been appropriately vetted through a national fingerprint-\nbased record check and have been granted access to CJI. 12/27/2024\nCJISSECPOL v6.0\nG.6-3 What is Encryption? Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a manner that only people\nwith the knowledge or means to decrypt the message can do so. But how does this work? In an encryption process, legible data , referred to as plaintext, is encrypted by applying a cipher\n(otherwise known as an encryption algorithm or crypto key) to the data. The data then becomes\nencrypted and is now referred to as ciphertext . The ciphertext is essentially unreadable until\ndecrypted. The decryption process requires the process of applying the same algorithm (crypto\nkey) to encrypt the data in an inverse manner to convert the data back into plaintext. Encryption is important because it allows you to securely protect data that you don't want anyone\nelse to have access to. Encryption has ",
